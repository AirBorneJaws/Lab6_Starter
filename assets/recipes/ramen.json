The recipe was easy to follow and was quick to make without buying a lot of ingredients (we already had a fairly well-stocked pantry). We did substitute coconut aminos for soy sauce without any discernible change in flavor from other ramen recipes we have tried in the past. Also, instead of using skin-on chicken (first started in a skillet and finished in the oven), we chose to use boneless, skinless chicken cooked entirely in the oven (375 degrees F for about 35 to 40 minutes). The only thing I might add next time would be wasabi sprouts (not spicy) or clover sprouts. This is more for personal preference as I can't say anything was lacking in the depth and complexity of the flavors in this recipe.

This is a great simple version of home cooked Ramen. Add thin slices of brisket or pork with a pork/beef broth base and hoisen sauce if you want a more savory simple stock, or take 4 hours to make Ramen from a recipe that doesn't say \"simple\".

I suggest adding daikon radish, naruto, sesame seed, and dried seaweed. Also, this recipe reheats quite well- the broth, at least. I generally use quadruple all the broth ingredients and make about a gallon in total. Rather than adding the mushrooms to the broth, I boil my ramen noodles in a separate pot, and the mushrooms along with them.

I made it for my family (glad I doubled the recipe so that we would have leftovers) and they loved it too. I was nervous about the chicken not being flavored, so I did a quick rub with five spice (in addition to the salt and pepper) and a dash of Shaoxing cooking wine right before popping them into the pan and it led to a nice crust on the chicken breasts. I also doubled the amount of mushrooms and used fresh, and threw them in a pan with some oil at medium high heat for a few minutes to brown them before putting them into the broth and it turned out to be a hit. Love how versatile this broth is; I put some carrots in it because it\u2019s what we had around, but next time I might throw in some other veggies.

I\u2019m no cooking snob, so if you like this recipe, great!  But call it chicken soup with ramen noodles, please. Nearly every variety of ramen has a very distinctive flavor from the stock made from seaweed and dried fish. Then the tare adds that super punch of flavors - salty, umami, deep, and complex.  It always has an oil component that give a richness to the dish, and that is totally absent here.  You don\u2019t include the essential varieties of toppings like fermented bamboo, leafy greens, dried seaweed as the bare minimum.   Japan is rightly proud of their ramen, so this Westernized version isn\u2019t going to give anyone an idea what ramen is all about, but to be totally fair, it\u2019s light years ahead of those cheap packets we all ate in college.

I ask because I found it highly flavorful and I definitely don\u2019t like a bland ramen. Each flavoring step is important: salt and pepper the chicken prior to putting in the skillet with the butter, use the exact amounts of garlic and ginger, unless you prefer more of either. Perhaps yours were old?  I had to use white mushrooms as I didn\u2019t have shitake (which are more flavorful). And I cut the amount of soy sauce by 1/2 T because it wasn\u2019t the low salt version snd I didn\u2019t want too much salt flavor."},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"CookingGirl"},"datePublished":"2021-10-03","reviewBody":"This turned out really good!!
