She thought she would become an epidemiologist, obtaining a sociology degree at UCLA and a Masters in Public Health at USC. But what began as a grad school hobby blog is now her full-time job. Originally from Queens and living most of her life in Los Angeles, she now resides in Chicago with her crazy corgi duo, Butters and Cartman. She loves donuts and binging on Grey's Anatomy reruns, and hopes to one day start her very own corgi rescue.","sameAs":["https://damndelicious.net","https://www.facebook.com/damndeliciousblog","https://www.instagram.com/damn_delicious/","https://twitter.com/@damn_delicious"]}]}
