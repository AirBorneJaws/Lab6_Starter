(I have been known for asking restaurants to sub cashews for peanuts.)  The sauce is great!  The only thing I would change is the amount of dried chile peppers.  Either I'll cut the amount called for in half or leave them whole instead of cutting them in half.  The reason being, it is VERY spicy and my husband could hardly eat it...the wimp!  But I will definitely make it again and have already saved the recipe.  Happy to have found this recipe, thanks!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gerald"},"reviewBody":"First go of it tonight enjoyed much","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Colleen"},"reviewBody":"This was absolutely fantastic.
